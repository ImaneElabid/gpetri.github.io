Course Overview</A>
</H1>

<P>
The goal of this course is the study of programming languages from a
foundational viewpoint. We will examine the design, implementation
and theory of programming languages features.
 We will give particular emphasis on aspects of reliability, both of
the language and of programs written using the language.
To that end, we will develop and use tools that enable reasoning about
both the design and specification of new language features, and that
allow precise understanding of the rationale for existing features in
modern languages.
This course will <EM>not</EM> be a survey of existing languages or language
features.  Instead, we will explore ways to understand programming languages
generally that help us to answer questions such as the following:

<P>

<OL>
<LI>What is a program <EM>specification</EM> and what role do
specifications play in program construction and reliability?

<P>
</LI>
<LI>What are sensible and tractable notions of program correctness?

<P>
</LI>
<LI>How do we qualify notions of abstraction and types found in modern
  programming languages?  Can we formalize the relationship between types
  and computation?

<P>
</LI>
<LI>How do we rigorously express the meaning of program structures,
  and <EM>prove</EM> useful properties about them?  

<P>
</LI>
<LI>What tools can we bring to bear to help automate such proofs?

<P>
</LI>
</OL>

<P>
To help answer these questions, the course is designed around several
interleaved themes: (1) the role of logic and proofs in programming language
design; (2) formal reasoning devices (aka operational and axiomatic
semantics) that precisely explain the meaning of programming language
features and program executions; (3) the use of types to define and specify
safety conditions on program executions, and to enrich language
expressivity; (4) the use of automated proof assistants to help validate
important theorems that describe useful properties based on the structure of
(2) and (3), using techniques enabled by (1).

<P>
At the end of this class, students should be comfortable with modern notions
of language semantics and specification, have developed sufficient
mathematical maturity to formally prove interesting properties about a
language features, type systems, or complex computation structures
generally, and be capable of understanding current research trends in the
field.

<P>
The course will be divided into roughly four parts:

<P>

<OL>
<LI>The first part of the course will introduce students to mechanized
  proof assistants.  We will use Coq, an expressive and powerful proof
  assistant that enables interactive construction of formal constructive
  proofs.  

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The second part of the course will introduce student to program
  logics, inductive reasoning principles, the relationship between
  proofs and programming, and related proof methods.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The third part of the course will provide an overview of
  different semantic models (both axiomatic and operational), will
  introduce different notions of interpretation and evaluation,
  discuss program specification techniques, and formalize notions of
  program equivalence.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The fourth part of the course will focus on types, with special
  emphasis on the typed lambda-calculus, a core language within which
  different type systems (e.g., simple types, subtyping, polymorphism) can
  be precisely studied.

<P>
</LI>
</OL>
