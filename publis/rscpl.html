<b>Abstract:</b>
  <p> 
  We address the problem of ensuring that a multithreaded program appears to have
  sequentially consistent semantics when the implementation of the language provides it
  with a relaxed semantics (aka a weak memory model). We introduce a new operational
  formalization of such a relaxed semantics, generalizing write buffering models.  Our
  formulation involves a "temporary store" where the memory operations issued by the
  threads are recorded, in program order. We define the conditions under which a pending
  operation from this sequence is allowed to be globally performed, possibly out of
  order. We then identify a sufficient condition for a program to behave in a sequentially
  consistent way in the relaxed semantics. Finally we design a type and behavioral effect
  system for enforcing this condition in our language, thus guaranteeing sequential
  consistency.
